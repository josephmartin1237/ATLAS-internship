# ATLAS-internship
My work alongside the ATLAS project, centred around dark matter detection 

Any files written in IDLE (.py) are first iterations of the code, this is what most of the project is written in however this means it is slower and clunkier. Warning for those who wish to run this code bare in mind most of it is prototype and will contain warnings and possible errors. These messier files are built entirely for the masochistic coder who wants to see the development. 

Any files written in Anaconda (.ipynb) are much neater, optimised and overall more pleasently built, therefore if you want to skip all the development and get straight to the good stuff look no further. 

The ATLAS project working diary is the presentation to accompany my work.
